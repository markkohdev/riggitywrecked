### About
My roomate and I started coming up with rules for the show because we didn't like the ones that were out there.  After realizing that we had too many rules for your casual game, we figured it'd be fun to assign different levels depending how much you wanted to turn up.  Thus, the site idea was born.

Written in AngularJS, with love to Gulp, Angular Material, and of course, [Adult Swim]

### Installation
Run this kush (if on Debian linux)
```
sudo ./install.sh
make install
```
that should be it I think?

### Running

```
make run
```
then go to http://localhost:5000 and get crunk

### TODO
 - [ ] Add the ability to create and save (to local storage) your own rules
 - [ ] Add konami code easter egg to bring up random R&M youtube videos
 - [ ] Create special rules for specific episodes
 - [x] Get *riggity riggity wrecked!!*
